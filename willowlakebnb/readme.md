Designed and developed this site for a fictitious business, Willow Lake Bed & Breakfast, based on a prompt provided by [FBLA](https://www.fbla-pbl.org/fbla/competitive-events/). After presenting to judges, our team won 2nd place at the California state level in April 2014 and **1st place nationally** in July 2014.

Original prompt:
> Develop a website for a Bed and Breakfast in your community. The B&B, Willow Lake, offers honeymoon and anniversary packages, extended stay packages, and general one- or two-night accommodations for travelers. The business also hosts afternoon tea parties for special occasions such as birthdays and wedding/shower parties. The French-inspired breakfast menu includes fruit and cheese crepes, various croissants, as well as gluten-free options. The “Tea Party” service includes high-end custom teas and finger sandwiches with an assortment of finger-food dessert options. The B&B resides in a refurbished home constructed in the 1800s. It features a fire place in each room, authentically-furnished living and dining rooms, and an outdoor patio with formal gardens perfect for entertaining. Highlight (and provide links to) home pages of local attractions that would entice individuals to stay on the property. Also highlight local restaurants for other meal functions. All information may be based upon your local community or fictitious information.

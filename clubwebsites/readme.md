# Club Websites

**Time period:** June 2013 â€“ August 2013

**Keywords:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, visual design

I designed and developed websites for several clubs at Homestead High School. These were collectively used by over 1200 students over 4 years, and some are still being used today.

Specifically, I created an event signup system for community service organizations to manage events, members, and volunteer hours. Previously, these were tracked in a mess of various spreadsheets and emails. I implemented my system with user-friendly admin panels and later as a Wordpress plugin.

# Heidi's Archive
This site serves as an archive of everything I've ever worked on. **It's more for myself than anyone else.** I chose to show all the projects I've ever worked on, as opposed to a select few that I want to show off. _I think everything in the past makes me who I am today, and I want to recognize that._

**Most of these pages are still drafts** because words are hard.

## Currently (October 2019)
I'm currently a junior at UC Berkeley studying **computer science** and **landscape architecture**! This semester, catch me mentoring an urban design project with SITELAB Urban Studios through [Berkeley Innovation](https://berkeleyinnovation.org) as well as teaching the [Web Design DeCal](https://wdd.io).

## Guided Tours
The list on the left is organized in reverse chronological order, but I've outlined some more guided tours below.

### Work Experience
- For **frontend UI** work in **React**, see my most recent two summer internships at [Flexport](https://heidid.github.io/archive/?id=flexport) (2019) and [PayPal](https://heidid.github.io/archive/?id=paypal) (2018). I'm specifically interested in the **design systems** and how they unify UI/UX across products.
- See my **web design** work and **mobile app design** case study from my internship at [Keewi](https://heidid.github.io/archive/?id=keewi) (2017).

### Design Projects
- I've been involved with [Berkeley Innovation](https://berkeleyinnovation.org), where we use the **human-centered design process** to work on design projects for clients every semester.
  - In 2018, as a consultant, I worked on [web design for The Crucible](https://heidid.github.io/archive/?id=crucible) and [UI design for MapD (now Omnisci)](https://heidid.github.io/archive/?id=mapd).
  - More recently, as a project mentor, I guided the team that worked on [product design for Telos.ai](https://www.behance.net/gallery/81130587/Telos).
- **Nearly all of my projects** involved UI/UX, web, and/or visual design work! I consider design a crucial aspect of every project and always make sure to dedicate time to it.

### Old Stuff
- Some of my first websites, in 2013: [Woodell Computers](https://heidid.github.io/archive/?id=woodellcomputers) and [Yoga with Miki](https://heidid.github.io/archive/?id=yogawithmiki)
- I learned to code on [Neopets](https://heidid.github.io/archive/?id=neopets).

# Heidi's Archive
This site serves as an archive of everything I've ever worked on. **It's more for myself than anyone else.** I chose to show all the projects I've ever worked on, as opposed to a select few that I want to show off. I think everything in the past makes me who I am today, and I want to recognize that.

**Most of these pages are still drafts** because words are hard.

The list on the left is organized in reverse chronological order, but I've outlined some more guided tours below.

## Work Experience
- For **frontend UI** work in **React**, see my most recent two summer internships at [Flexport](https://heidid.github.io/archive/?id=flexport) (2019) and [PayPal](https://heidid.github.io/archive/?id=paypal) (2018).
- At [Keewi](https://heidid.github.io/archive/?id=keewi) (2017) I also did **web design** and **mobile app design** work.

## Design Work
- I've been involved with [Berkeley Innovation](https://berkeleyinnovation.org), where we use the human-centered design process to work on design projects for clients every semester. In 2018, as a consultant, I worked on [web design for The Crucible](https://heidid.github.io/archive/?id=crucible) and [UI design for MapD (now Omnisci)](https://heidid.github.io/archive/?id=mapd). More recently, as a project mentor, I guided the team that worked on [product design for Telos.ai](https://www.behance.net/gallery/81130587/Telos).
- **Nearly all of my projects** involved UI/UX, web, and/or visual design work! I consider design a crucial aspect of every project and always make sure to dedicate time to it.

## Old Stuff
- Some of my first websites, in 2013: [Woodell Computers](https://heidid.github.io/archive/?id=woodellcomputers) and [Yoga with Miki](https://heidid.github.io/archive/?id=yogawithmiki)
- I learned to code on [Neopets](https://heidid.github.io/archive/?id=neopets).

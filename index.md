# Heidi's Archive
This site serves as an archive of everything I've ever worked on. **It's more for myself than anyone else.** I chose to show all the projects I've ever worked on, as opposed to a select few that I want to show off. I think everything in the past makes me who I am today, and I want to recognize that.

**Most of these pages are still drafts** because words are hard.

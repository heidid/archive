In high school, one thing we did a lot was changing our profile pictures on Facebook to advertise for upcoming events. I had the idea of creating custom profile pictures where the promo graphic would be overlayed as a banner or frame on an existing profile picture. This was before [Facebook's frame feature](https://www.facebook.com/help/1476775522631878) existed. My tool was used by 300+ students in social media campaigns over 3 years.
